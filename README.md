## Backend Setup

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_encoded_private_key
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory if you want to change the API URL:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will open at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port)

## Usage

1. Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running
